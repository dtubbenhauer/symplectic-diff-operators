# symplectic-diff-operators

You can find a (short and hopefully sweet) Magma code to compute symplectic differential algebras on this page. The code is in the text file and can be run in e.g. the online version of the Magma calculator <a href="http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/">http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/calc/</a>

The main references are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04264">https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04264</a> for the symplectic version and 
<a href="https://eudml.org/doc/90416">https://eudml.org/doc/90416</a> for the orthogonal version.

References for the recalled background below can also be found in the first paper.

# Background

Fix some $n>0$. Let $\mathcal{A}=\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$ for a formal parameter $q$.

The **exterior algebra of the vector representation of type C** is an $\mathcal{A}$-algebra denoted $\Lambda_{\mathcal{A}}$ of dimension $2^{2n}$ with generators
$$X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n,X_{-n},\dots,X_2,X_1$$
that satisfy quantum versions of exterior generators. (See for example the code itself.)

Dually, the **dual** exterior algebra of the vector representation of type C is an $\mathcal{A}$-algebra denoted $\Lambda_{\mathcal{A}}^{*}$ of dimension $2^{2n}$ with generators
$$\partial_1,\partial_2,\dots,\partial_n,\partial_{-n},\dots,\partial_2,\partial_1$$
that satisfy quantum versions of exterior generators.

Following maybe people, such as Weyl, we think of the $X_i$ as polynomial variables and as the $\partial_i$ as differential operators acting on them. We collect these into the **symplectic operator algebra** denoted by $\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{A}}$. 

This algebra is now generated by
$$X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n,X_{-n},\dots,X_2,X_1,\partial_1,\partial_2,\dots,\partial_n,\partial_{-n},\dots,\partial_2,\partial_1$$
subject to relations that mimic and quantize the action of **differntial operators on polynomials**.

For example, the classical relation
$$\partial_{i}X_i=X_i\partial_{i}+1$$
in this algebra takes e.g. the form
$$\partial_{i}X_i=-X_i\partial_{i}+1+(q+q^{-1})\cdot\text{error term}.$$
Note that for $q=1$ the error term vanishes. Details can be found e.g. in the code.

# Running the code

The various pieces of the code run directly in the Magma online calculator. For example,

> //Basis for D; here n=1 with delta_1=d1, delta_-1=c1, X_1=v1 and X_-1=w1
>
> k<q>:=FieldOfFractions(PolynomialRing(Rationals(),1));
> D<w1,v1,c1,d1>:=FPAlgebra<k,w1,v1,c1,d1|w1^2,v1^2,c1^2,d1^2,w1*v1+q^2*v1*w1,c1*d1+q^(-2)*d1*c1,c1*w1+w1*c1-(q^4-1)*v1*d1-1,c1*v1+> (q^2)*v1*c1,d1*v1+v1*d1-1,d1*w1+(q^2)*w1*d1>;
> Dimension(D);
> V,Vf:=Algebra(D);
> [V.i@@Vf: i in [1 .. Dimension(V)]];
  
This innitiates the operator algebra for n=1, calculates its dimension and gives a standard basis.
